# ThingSpeak C library (libthingspeak)

## Beta Release Notes

  The goals of the design had been focused on supporting *unix* platforms
  and providing simple wrapper methods that will enable users to implement
  a very functional ThingSpeak agent application on an platform that supports BSD sockets.

## Get started

Run this from the shell:

      git clone  https://github.com/gabrield/libthingspeak
      cd libthingspeak
      make all

## Contributing

  I use GitHub fork/pull-request model and encourage users to contribute
  changes back. The general guideline is to submit no more then one feature
  in a single pull-request and each individual commit should contain only
  related changes.
